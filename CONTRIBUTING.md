Welcome To HubSync
==================

Hi! Nice to see you here!

Ongoing Development
===================

Please note the project is still in a really early state, but it already welcomes contributions.

If you'd like to ask a question
===============================

The github issue tracker is the right place to submit any bug or request for update. Just tag it properly. Feel free to mail any author for complex questions.

If you'd like to contribute code
================================

We welcome pull requests but please:

 - Be sure all Pull requests have a github issue that has been acknowledged
 - Note that all PRs will be validated by travis. See .travis.yml for the steps it runs
 - Your code needs to work in Python 2.7 and 3.5
 - Your code follows PEP8 (It is ok if some lines are 80ish, we are not that strict, but PEP8 should generally be followed)
 - Run a linter, we recommend pylint
 - Write unit tests for all new code being submitted
 - We use four spaces for indentation
 - Dont submit merge commits, please rebase

Thanks!
