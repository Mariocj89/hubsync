Please note the project is still in a really early state, but it already welcomes contributions.

Please see mail any of the authors and we'll happy answer any question you might have.

The github issue tracker is the right place to submit any bug or request for update.

If you'd like to contribute code
================================

We welcome pull requests but please:

 - Be sure all Pull requests have a github issue that has been acknowledged
 - Your code follows PEP8 (It is ok if some lines are 80ish, we are not that strict, but PEP8 should generally be followed)
 - Run a linter, we recommend pylint
 - Write unit tests for all new code being submitted
 - We use four spaces for indentation
 - Dont submit merge commits, please rebase

Thanks!
